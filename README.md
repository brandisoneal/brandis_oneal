# Hi there, I'm Brandis ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a a project manager, business anlayst, and product manager. One day, I'll be a coder but life got in the way when I had a chance. Plus, I'm the oldest millenial (born when Reagan was prez), and I went to school when everyone only had desktop computers and flip phones. That means, technology wasn't abundantly available and at everyone's fingertips. Only true nerds and math whizzes were coders. Now, they teach programming in kindergarten with Scratch Jr :-) Just saying, I'm on this application for the ReadMe files to understand the purpose of the code. I ain't building didly squat. I'm definitely not reviewing and accessing code. 

## ðŸ›  Skills

## âš¡ Fun Fact
Why do all programming spaces aim to include random hobbies and interests about a person. Plus most coders like interest that are opposite of their day-to-day technical problem-solving. It's almost cliche that a programmer loves the "outdoor and spending time with his pets/family and traveling". Btw, I like those things too and whole host of stuff but you have to actually aske me in a conversation :-)
